This repository has all files necessary to perform the Elmer/Ice simulations
presented in Schannwell et al. "Glacial cycle ice-sheet evolution controlled by
ocean bed properties".
The Elmer/Ice input files for the initialisation
(inversion) and for the forward simulations using the direct and iterative ice
velocity setup can be found in SifFiles.

The necessary input data can be found under InputData and all code userdefined
code for the experiments is under src. Paths given in the SifFiles to the code
files need to be adjusted. Also compilation of these function should be done
with the same compiler as the main Elmer/Ice code compilation.
